# About Me

<img src="images/me.jpg" class="floatpic">

Hi, I am **Anthony Tong**.

I am a second year undergraduate student double majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics
at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and interested in multimodality and reasoning in large
language models and theoretical AI, as well as more broadly in computer vision applications.

I am currently advised by Professor [Edwin Solares](https://edwinsolares.com/) on multiple ongoing
computer vision projects regarding species rescue and agricultural and language conservation, as
well as Professors [Shengjie (Patrick) Zhai](https://www.unlv.edu/people/shengjie-zhai) and
[Ming Zhu](https://www.unlv.edu/people/ming-zhu-phd) on an analytical project on LLM tokenization
and domain adaptation. I am also grateful to have previously worked with Professor
[Arya Mazumdar](https://mazumdar.ucsd.edu/) as part of the Regents Scholars Research Initiative
(RSRI) on some topics exploring logistic regression and diffusion generative models.

More updates to this website coming soon!
